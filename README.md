# Create a React App From Scratch

## Purpose
- This is more for myself than anything.
- I wanted to learn what exactly `create-react-app` does, what plugins are used, what babel and webpack actually do, and what things might be included in `create-react-app` that I don't really need.
- My notes are all saved in my notes app, but otherwise, this does provide a template for the necessary things (see package.json dev dependencies)

## Future
- I'll be adding comments in the necessary places so that anyone who feels the desire can look at this and see what exactly each thing (e.g. css-loader or webpack-dev-server) contributes to the app.
